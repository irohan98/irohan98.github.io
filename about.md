      <h3>Leadership</h3>
      <p>
        I have experienced leadership throughout my career. I was the Joint Secretary of the
        Electronics, Communication and Instrumentation Forum (ECIF) during my undergraduate
        studies, and also the Head Coordinator for multiple technical and cultural fests during the
        same year. I have also taken up multiple responsibilities during my time at Toastmasters
        Amrita Bengaluru (TAB).
