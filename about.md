      <h3>Leadership</h3>
      <p>
        I have led ML initiatives at work end-to-end, partnering with Android engineers and
        product stakeholders to ship production features, and I enjoy mentoring and driving
        cross-functional execution. Outside work, I served as Joint Secretary of the Electronics,
        Communication and Instrumentation Forum (ECIF), Head Coordinator for multiple technical
        and cultural fests, and held leadership roles at Toastmasters Amrita Bengaluru (TAB).
