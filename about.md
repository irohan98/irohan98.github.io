"Every day is a new opportunity. You can build on yesterday's success or put its failures behind and start over again!"


I am a passionate engineer currently pursuing a Master's degree in Computer Engineering at The University of Texas at Dallas (UTD) and will graduate in May, 2023. 
I am interested in AI and other facets of AI. I like to solve real world problems and learn from them everyday. My knowledge is spread across in various domains like Machine Learning (ML), Natural Language Processing (NLP), Computer Vision (CV), and Hardware Programming.

I am currently working as the 'Machine Learning Intern' at [CyberDive](https://www.cyberdive.co/)
